"""Task 1 Non-Cyclical Number
A non-cyclical number is an integer defined by the following algorithm:

Given a positive integer, replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the above step until the number equals 1, or it loops infinitely in a cycle which does not include 1.
If it stops at 1, then the number is a non-cyclical number.
Given a positive integer n, return true if it is a non-cyclical number, otherwise return false.
