"""Task 7 Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q,
return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such
that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.
