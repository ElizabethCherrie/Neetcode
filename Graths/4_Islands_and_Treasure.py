"""Task 4 Islands and Treasure
You are given a mÃ—n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

-1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
0 - A treasure chest.
INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach 
a treasure chest then the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

Modify the grid in-place.
